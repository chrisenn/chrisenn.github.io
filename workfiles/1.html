Journey
Before State: Winging It - short term > long term
Save whatever they can after our short term needs and wants are met
Savings account, RRSP, TFSA but no urgency, relatively hands off
Trigger: When long term is not as long term anymore (e.g. when they have a child or when they’re nearing retirement, etc.), that’s when they start worrying
Potential secondary user type: if they get enough money to actually do things with and they are focusing on the long term
Research
Tried self-help resources but too hard? Doesn’t feel like they have the expertise? (Find out: what motivates them to go to an FA instead of DIY?)
Get advice about goals
Discovery
Talk to FA about goals and how to achieve them
FA recommends products and a plan of action to achieve those goals based on projections
Financial Advisor has periodic (e.g. yearly) statements/checkups updating situation and/or plan
Written plan
Action Items
There is a behaviour change required of the user. They’re used to being focused on the short term.
Their long term goals are brought into the short term with CGP, which is a dynamic, simplified version of their written pslan
They can visualize their path to their desired end-state
They can see what they need to do broken down into actionable steps that they can take in the short term. They can easily keep track of what they need to do vs what they’ve done.
They can see the effect of their short term actions on their long term goal, providing motivation, accountability and peace of mind
Trigger for completing action items (Find out)
When they get paid?
End of a period (e.g. month)?
Find out: where do the action items take place?
Find out: when would they need to look at their living plan?
Research Objectives
Decisions to be informed by this research
Should we have action items?
If so, should we have checkboxes?
Evaluate desirability of feature (not usability)
Explore problem
Validate solution
Action Items themselves
Checkboxes
Hypotheses
The checkboxes will make it easier for them to track what they need to do
The non-checkbox version will more communicate that these are reminders
Methodology
The main portion of the session will be an interview about the participant’s experience with tracking their goals
Do they know what they have to do?
Do they know their progress?
Do they have a process for tracking or is it all in their head?
Role of financial advisor?
Show them the prototype at the end and ask them to explain it
What is their understanding of it?
Compare it to their actual situation
Administer Kano model questions in a guided survey, asking them to elaborate for each
