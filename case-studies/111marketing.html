    <title>Chris Nguyen: UX</title>
</head>


<h2>Project</h2>
<p>The product allowed marketers to personalize their marketing efforts on at the individual level by leveraging data about customers' behaviour. The client had already thought through the requirements and the project was to design the product.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<h2>Process</h2>
<ol>
<li />Discovery
<li />Design
</li />
</ol>

<h2>Role</h2>
I was responsible for leading the discovery and UX design. Final UI design was contributed by a colleague.

<h2>Discovery</h2>

<ul>
<li />Gathered all of the client's existing resources (pitch decks, user stories, sample spreadsheets, etc.)
<li />Interviewed stakeholders/subject matter experts
<li />Performed additional desk research on personalization marketing and looked at competitors 
<li />Synthesised the findings into persona/experience map 
<li />Iterated on the experience map with the client in subsequent meetings to build out the requirements and ensure that we were all on the same page
</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>
<ul>
<li />Low fidelity wireframes based on initial sketches
<li />Weekly meetings where I showed my progress and asked/answered questions 
<li />Iterations based on self-evaluation and feedback from colleagues/clients
<li />Once we had checked off all of the user stories, we moved onto high fidelity.
<li />A colleague took over for the visual design/branding stage.
</ul>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<blockquote>"Initial user feedback was extremely positive. ROSSUL designed an intuitive UI. The team at ROSSUL is thoughtful and hardworking. Their creative approach complemented their professional management style. Customers can expect an invested team that delivers on time."</blockquote>
