            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>I was the founding researcher on the team for CIBC Smart Planner, helping to build it from the ground up. This was a personal finance tool to help with money management to help scale financial advice/planning for those who did not have a dedicated financial advisor. At the time, this was not functionality that was available in any of the major banking apps.</p>

            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>I was a thought partner to product and design, and I helped ground our strategy in user needs. I also presented to a wide audience of stakeholders every two weeks (along with design and product) to update on progress and what we learned that sprint, and for us all to discuss and make decisions. In all of these conversations, big and small, I would give input based on research that we had done and/or identify research opportunities, which I had in a prioritized research backlog that I maintained.</p>

            <h2>Early Research</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At the outset of the project, I did some research with SMEs and desk research to come up with our base personas (at both ends of the money management spectrum) and the journey to get from one to the other
                <li> Our understanding of this journey informed our design (e.g. our task flows, goals and information needs at each stage, etc.) and it also provided a structure in which all other research could fit
                <li> Throughout the project, as I conducted more and more interviews, I would fill in more of the picture with more specific behavioural topics as well as research into specific financial goals
