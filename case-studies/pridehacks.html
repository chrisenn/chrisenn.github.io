            <p>Using a combination of briefing documents and question time with stakeholders from the organization. We modelled what we knew of the problem space.</p>

            <img src="pridehacks/CGLCC Diagram.jpg" class="col-lg-10 col-md-12" />

            <p>There were three main processes that we identified:</p>

                <li>Application (Suppliers)</li>
                <li>Certification process (CGLCC)</li>
                <li>Looking for a supplier (CGLCC Members)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The moment we were solving for was the third. Currently, all the suppliers are kept in an Excel sheet (updated quarterly), which is then emailed to people making inquiries.</p>

            <h2>Getting On The Same Page</h2>
            <p>Our group had a lot of ideas that spanned many different parts of the process/organization, but this threatened scope creep. There was also the temptation to jump straight into solutioning and detailed design. The developer and I worked together to get the group to adopt an MVP approach, with a prioritised list of user stories (including must haves and nice to haves).</p>

    <section id="solutioni">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Solution I</h2>
            <p><img src="pridehacks/solutiondiagram.jpg" class="col-lg-8 col-sm-12" /></p>
            <p>Creating a platform that allowed:
                <ul>
                    <li>CGLCC members to pay for/renew their membership and view/search the directory of suppliers</li>
                    <li>CGLCC staff to add suppliers to the directory and administer the platform</li>
                    <li>Suppliers to reapply for their listing and edit their information.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The application form was also to be changed to include tax codes for the industries of the businesses to assist with mapping to human-readable keywords/search terms.
            </p>

            <p>
                This solved the problem because:
                <ul>
                    <li>Information would be up to date</li>
                    <li>It would be more secure</li>
                    <li>More opportunity to make it searchable by human readable terms and find specific services</li>
                    <li>More user friendly format than plain text data in a spreadsheet</li>
                    <li>More instantaneous so people don't satisfice with a (possibly non-LGBT) supplier found via other means</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Pragmatism</h2>
            <p>The vision was ambitious because we didn't necessarily have to prototype <em>everything</em> during the hackathon. However, one of the mentors advised us that we should think about feasibility and whether there are any off-the-shelf products/components that we could use.</p>

            <p>We toned down our solution. The only custom part of it would be the <a href="https://invis.io/NBG11413VKH#/281319353_Search">CGLCC Member side</a> (looking for a supplier). The suppliers would be added via a Google Form, linked to a Google Sheets, linked to FireBase (easier to set up for non-technical people).</p>

            <p><img src="pridehacks/mockup2.jpg" class="col-12" /></p>
            <p>I was in charge of prototyping the directory, but first I <a href="pridehacks/journey.jpg">mapped out the user journey</a> using the scenario of someone finding a caterer for their company's meetup in three weeks. Luckily, I had done user research for a services marketplace in a previous job, so my assumptions in this exercise were more informed than they otherwise would have been. The journey mapping influenced the design of the portal in the following ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The content:</strong> What are the factors they are using the evaluate businesses and make decisions? (Refer to journey map)</li>
                <li><strong>System qualities:</strong> We are only one of several avenues that the user would be using (e.g. Google, word of mouth, etc.) so we needed to be open and conducive to a broader search/comparison</li>
                <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> The shortlist feature came out of the natural funnelling process that users would be doing to narrow down who to choose</li>
            </ul>
