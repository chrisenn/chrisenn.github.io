            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Having received a spec from the project manager, I went back and forth with them during which I made some low fidelity prototypes, received feedback and iterated. Once we got it settled, I made my prototype high fidelity. I had intended to use the client's branding and visual style for consistency but I noticed that their current website was a patchwork of different systems with different branding. Hence, I came to decision that I would take the branding, but make the actual interface look different to the marketing website. This was to communicate implicitly that when they log into this new system, it does not carry over to any other part of the client's website – it is standalone, much like the others.</p>

    <section id="development">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>The prototype had received positive feedback from the client and they signed off. However, during development, we encountered some challenges. Although the client had signed off on the proposal, other departments were now getting involved and this caused the (sometimes contradictory) requirements to keep changing over a period of time, which hindered development from advancing. We eventually put a hard stop to it, but even then, it had already taken up a lot of time. The other major challenge we had was that we underestimated how difficult it would be to implement accessibility, particularly screen reader compatibility across different browsers. With our small team, we needed to work across silos if we were going to deliver on time. I helped the developers with the accessibility guidelines. Another designer, the project manager and I took the role of QA and we helped with testing, debugging and helping to find solutions. We also had a feedback loop with the client’s QA to guide us. Through the adversity, we banded together as a team and ended up delivering the product, passing the client’s QA/UAT.</p>
