		<h2>Product</h2>
<p>A website for a large government data agency to connect the policymakers, advocacy groups and academics with UNESCO data for their Sustainable Development Goals for the purposes of research and advocacy.</p>

<h2>Project Goal</h2>
<p>They already had a prototype that they wanted to test. It was a new WordPress Theme, with a different layout, streamlined content and added navigation. In addition to the discovery of any general usability problems of the new layout, the navigation and ease of finding things was singled out as a priority.</p>

<h2>Potential Approaches</h2>
<ol>
<li />A/B Testing
<li />Usability Testing
<li />Tree Testing
</ol>

<p>If it were just the nav, I would have chosen tree testing but because we were also interested in usability of the pages themselves so I went with usability testing, but integrated some tree testing-esque metrics.</p>

<p>The reason I didn't go with A/B testing was because there were no real "conversions" to be had, and we also wanted qualitative data.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<ol>
<li />Discovery
<li />Test Preparation
<l1 />Test Moderation 
<li />Synthesis
<li />Reporting Back to the Client
</ol>

<h2>Discovery</h2>
<ul>
	<li />Working with the stakeholders to establish their objectives
	<li />Formulating a research plan
	<li />Examining the site to be tested and researching how it fits in with other UN sites/departments
	<li />Working with stakeholders to consolidate their personas (they were very granular with some overlap) into four groups for testing, decided on recruitment criteria and derived user goals/workflows to be tested.
</ul>

<h2>Test Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li />Recruitment and screening
<li />Developing the scenarios and success criteria based on the output of discovery phase (working collaboratively with the client)
<li />Preparing the script and protocol
<li />Metrics:
	<ul>
		<li />First Nav Time
		<li />First Nav Selection
		<li />Task Time
		<li />Sucess Rate
		<li />Error Rate
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Test Moderation</h2>
<ul>
<li />I conducted 16 tests, representing four user groups.
<li />Given the global scope of the organization, we needed to do remote testing
<li />I used Zoom for the abiity to see the participant's screen and face, and to record the session
<li />Each test started with a short interview, which got the participant comfortable and talkative while also giving us additional qualitative data and allowing us to understand any idiosyncracies with how they use the site/technology.
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
<li />Generally high successs rate, but a few pages required some domain knowledge and others could have been categorised better or there were multiple places it could've been
<li />Hiding content decluttered the page but made it more difficult to find the hidden elements
<li />General lack of self-evidence and affordances
<li />Some pages needed a more defined hierarchy
<li />The main navigation included links to external sites, which disoriented users
<li />The results were delivered to the client via a report and a presentation
<li />Client was originally planning to run the whole thing using a Wordpress page builder. After the testing, they changed their mind and decided to develop their new website from scratch (RFP pending).
</ul>
